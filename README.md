# AI_ML_TASK_7

Task 7: Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Objective: Use SVMs for linear and non-linear classification.

Tools: Scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib

Dataset Used: Breast Cancer Dataset(Kaggle)

I have done he following things:
1.Load and prepare a dataset for binary classification.
2.Train an SVM with linear and RBF kernel.
3.Visualize decision boundary using 2D data.
4.Tune hyperparameters like C and gamma.
5.Use cross-validation to evaluate performance.
